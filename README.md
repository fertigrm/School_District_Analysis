# School_District_Analysis
## This Analysis was initally done for our client Maria to look through schools and find all sorts of information about them, from average grades, budget, type of school, etc.

# Results of the analysis
- It was determined that the 9th graders from Thomas High School had fabricated the data and we had to change thier data to null values
- Below is the inital Top 5 school analysis
